        <h1><center>EDUCATIONAL HISTORY</center></h1>
        <P>First of all i begun my Educational career in various 
            kindergertens which later helped me to graduate to primary schools
        </P>
        <p>
            the first primary school i joined was cps where i started for mainly my lower primary time 
            then i later joined mother majeri p/s for my upper primary. All i can say is that the 
            primary experience might not be the best but never the less i managed to get 8 AGGREGATES
        </p>
        <p>
            The points i got in Primary set me up for my secondary time where i went to 
            ST. marys kitende where i finished my UCE and UACE and i got 12 AGGREGATES
            and 16POINTS respectively
